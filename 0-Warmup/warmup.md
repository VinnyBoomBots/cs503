## Warmup Assignment

1. Select with an x the platform you will be using for your course deliverables:
    - [x] drexel's tux cluster
    - [ ] WSL on Windows
    - [ ] Orbstack on MacOs
    - [ ] VMWare Fusion
    - [ ] Somthing else (put name here)

2. I have installed my virtual machine, tested it, feel comfortable using it, and validated that the required software is installed:
    - [ ] YES
    - [X] N/A - I plan to use tux
    - [ ] NO - Not Yet

3. Please provide a link to the repository you are using for this class.\

4. Briefly describe what you want to get out of this class.\
In this course I hope to gain a thorough understanding of what a computer is _actually_ doing when I ask it to do the myriad things I require of it in a given day.
\
To give a bit of personal background, it was not until recently that I even had any interest in computers: my undergraduate degree was in the liberal arts, and most of my extracurricular interest was in literature (as I had literary pretensions myself, however silly that may sound). But if you were to comb my high-school transcript you would see that it was my math skills that got me into college in the first place, and although it took me fifteen years to reach this realization – namely that math pays and I can always read those great-big books in my free time – I am quite excited to be both building up, and hopefully flexing, my math muscles again. It honestly feels quite good – for one to be excited about a career path again, and two to be facing a genuine intellectual challenge that is more problem-solving based than dealing largely in abstractions, which is what I do now. I relish accomplishing difficult but concrete things these days – and I believe this Systems Basics course will be the most challenging course I’ve taken yet. Yet because of its under-the-hood subject matter, I believe it could also be the most fulfilling as well. 
\
I’ll admit: I was afraid of computers up until recently. I was afraid of their ability to distract and ruin attention spans; I was afraid of how they seemingly attempted to ease so many natural tensions out of life; I was afraid of how they were a crutch for the intellectually lethargic; and I was afraid of how dependence on them affected my own feeling of self-worth. Simply put, I believed (and still do) that computers and their interfaces were addicting, and I was afraid of what that addiction entailed for me. So for the past ten years, as a defense mechanism, I largely avoided them. (I also consistently talked mad trash on smart phones.)
\
But now I want to truly understand them. As an academic challenge, as an intellectual exercise – and, ideally, as a way to exorcise some of my most negative thoughts about them, allowing my greater understanding to dispel some of the trepidations I have about their worst effects. I say all that to say that I’m excited about this course – and I plan to get a lot out of it. (And I also want to thank computing for propelling economic growth, to my clear advantage, for the past 70 years. Great job, computers!)
5. Briefly describe any concerns you might be having with being successful in this class (if any).
\
And to pick up on my last response, my only concern about this course is my lack of tech bona fides. A lot of the lingo is over my head; a lot of command-line commands are foreign to me. I’ve never used Linux to accomplish any real-world tasks, so there will certainly be a learning curve for me. But as long as you are open to answering my questions, Professors Lilley and Do, I think I’ll be OK. I’m banking on my enthusiasm for the subject to carry me through the intellectual difficulties ahead!
